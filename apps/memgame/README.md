### How to play
*Playable Version Available* [here](https://betocostadev.github.io/apps/memgame/index.html).

**Game Rules**
Game starts as soons as you click play:
- The play will have 5 seconds to see how the cards were place and try to memorize it;
- Cards will be fliped and the player will only see the back side of each card;
 - Clicking on any card will flip it. Then:
   - The game will wait for the player to click on a next card;
   - By clicking on a second card the game will add a move count and will check if:
   - The cards are the same:
     - If they are, both cards will stay front-faced;
     - If they aren't, both cards will be fliped again and a move is counted;
- By clicking on all the correct pairs will finish the game and show a user score.
- If the player takes 1m 15s to complete the game, the time is up and the game is lost.
