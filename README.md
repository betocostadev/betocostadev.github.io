## Projects

### Pages
**Landing Page**: Created only with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. No libraries or frameworks were used. Also, no build system for this page.


### JS Apps
**VDK (Virtual Drum Kit)**: Project made using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
It is a small project, only 2 html files so, there was no need to use any frameworks or build tools.

**PaintBrowser**: Nothing here...
