## Projects

### Web-Clothing React Progressive Web App
Project Based on Udemy 's Course [Complete React Developer in 2019](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) by *Andrei Neagoie*, *Yihua Zhang*.

This project was huge and it gave me the opportunity the learn a lot about **React**.
You can find the code for the final version [here](https://github.com/betocostadev/web-clothing-react).

The final version was developed with React, Redux, Firebase, Firestore and Stripe, besides some other Frameworks.

In the course itself I have used much more, Hooks, State, GraphQL, and Node.

### My Blog

There is actually nothing there yet. I have just build the blog to start using **Gatsby** and see what I can do.

[Here](https://betoblog.netlify.com/) you check see the Blog, and [here](https://github.com/betocostadev/gatsby-blog) is the Source Code.

## About Me

*I'm Roberto Costa, Front-End Web Developer.*
I'm currently developing web pages and web apps, while I learn keep improving my skills like React, Node, MongoDB, Firestore, GraphQL and more.

Usually, my work flow is:
* A simple sketch for the page;
* A wireframe/mockup using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/);
* Search for resources (images, etc);
* Create a project on [Trello](https://trello.com/) to keep track of everything;
  * Actually I'm looking forward to use GitHub project flow to keep track for now on.
* Create a new Git branch for the project;
* Set the build tools such as [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/);
* Start the development;
* Test and keep developing!

That was before using React and Gatsby, now I don't usually need to use Gulp to build my projects.
