## About Me

*I'm Roberto Costa, Front-End Web Developer.*
I'm currently developing web pages and web apps, while I learn more technologies such as *React, MongoDB* and *Node.js*.
Usually, my workflow is:
* A simple sketch for the page;
* A wireframe/mockup using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/);
* Search for resources (images, etc);
* Create a project on [Trello](https://trello.com/) to keep track of everything;
* Create a new Git branch for the project;
* Set the build tools such as [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/);
* Start the development;
* Test and keep developing!
